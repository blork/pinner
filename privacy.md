Pinner retains your Pinboard username and API token within the app in order to implement some features. 
Your password is never saved on the device, and transmitted securely at most one time to exchange it for your API token.
These credentials are stored securely and are never transmitted outside the app to any service beside Pinboard itself. All 
sensitive information, both login credentials and bookmarks, is transmitted over secure channels (HTTPS). 
Your login credentials are never transmitted over the internet without encryption.
